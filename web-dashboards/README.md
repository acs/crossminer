# CROSSMINER Web-based Dashboard

The goal of this directory inside CROSSMINER project is to store all the activities related to **Task 7.4: Web-based dashboards** (`Web dashboards` from here).

The `Web dashboards` will present views of analysed projects that are:

* up to date
* high level
* quantitative panoramic

They will include specific metrics for tracking key performance aspects and will show details like who and how is contributing to a given project.

Dashboard panels will show summary, aggregated and evolutionary data, statistical analysis, faceted views, etc. for each data source.

The interface will allow to drill down into the data combining different filters (time ranges, projects, repositories, contributors).

The use cases that will be covered are:


* [Dependencies Dashboard](dependencies)
* API Changes Dashboard
* GrimoireLab Dashboard with Sentiment Analysis included
* Messages Dashboard with Top Threads and Top Topics
* System Configuration Dashboard()
* [Data Extraction from Knowledge Base](ossmeter-metrics)
* Cross-project relationship dashboard
* Web Dashboard access from IDE plugin
